- ✅ Deduplication (no duplicates)

## 🧪 What to Test First

### Priority 1: Pairing Mode (NEW)
```
1. Open app
2. Click "🔗 Pair" button
3. Check status shows pairing mode active
4. Go to Android TV Settings → Remote & Accessories
5. Look for "Android TV Remote" in the list
6. Connect to it
7. Try Volume Up button - TV volume should change
```

### Priority 2: Device Discovery (IMPROVED)
```
1. Click "📡 Connect via Bluetooth"
2. Click "🔍 Scan for Devices"
3. Wait for scan (should be smarter now)
4. Check if Android TV appears in top results
5. Try connecting to it
```

### Priority 3: All Buttons (TESTING)
Once connected:
- Press each button to verify TV responds
- Power, Volume, Channel, D-Pad, Home, Back, Menu, Mute

## 🐛 If Something Doesn't Work

### Check Logs
```bash
tail -f app.log  # See real-time logs
```

### Test Discovery Directly
```bash
python test_enhanced_bluetooth.py
# Shows detailed discovery results
```

### Test Pairing Mode
```bash
python test_hid_server.py
# Tests pairing mode without GUI
```

### Debug Info to Share
If issues occur, run this and share output:
```bash
python -c "
from bluetooth_hid_server import BLUETOOTH_AVAILABLE
from bluetooth_enhanced import EnhancedBluetoothDeviceManager
import asyncio

print(f'Bluetooth available: {BLUETOOTH_AVAILABLE}')
print(f'Enhanced discovery ready: {BLUETOOTH_AVAILABLE}')

async def test():
    manager = EnhancedBluetoothDeviceManager()
    devices = await manager.enhanced_discover_devices(timeout=8, retry_count=2)
    print(f'Found {len(devices)} devices')
    for d in devices[:5]:
        print(f'  - {d[\"name\"]} (Score: {d.get(\"quality_score\", 0)})')

asyncio.run(test())
"
```

## 📱 Expected Behavior

### When You Press Pair Button
```
App Status Updates:
1. "Entering pairing mode..."
2. "✅ Pairing mode active - remote is discoverable"
3. TV can now find "Android TV Remote"
4. After 2 minutes: "Pairing mode ended" (auto-exit)
```

### When Android TV Connects
```
App Status Updates:
1. TV searches: Settings → Remote & Accessories → Add accessory
2. TV finds: "Android TV Remote"
3. You tap it on TV
4. "🔗 Connected to: Android TV"
5. All buttons work immediately
```

### When You Press a Button (After Connection)
```
Power Button → TV powers on/off
Volume Up → TV volume increases
Home Button → TV shows home screen
D-Pad Up → Navigates up in menus
Channel Up → Changes channel
(etc. for all buttons)
```
