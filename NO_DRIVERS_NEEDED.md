# üö´ NO CUSTOM DRIVERS NEEDED!

## Summary: You're all set with standard drivers

Your Android TV Remote app uses **standard Bluetooth protocols** that are already built into:
- ‚úÖ Your laptop's operating system
- ‚úÖ Android TV's Bluetooth stack
- ‚úÖ All modern devices

## What You Actually Need (per platform)

### üêß **Linux** 
**Drivers**: Already installed
```bash
# Check if Bluetooth service is running
sudo systemctl status bluetooth

# If not installed (rare):
sudo apt install bluez
```

### ü™ü **Windows**
**Drivers**: Built into Windows
```powershell
# Check if Bluetooth service is running  
Get-Service bthserv
```

### üçé **macOS**
**Drivers**: Built into macOS (Core Bluetooth)
- No additional setup needed
- Works automatically

## What Protocols We Use (All Standard)

| Protocol | Purpose | Driver Needed |
|----------|---------|---------------|
| **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)** | Basic connection | ‚ùå Built-in |
| **HID (Human Interface Device)** | Remote control buttons | ‚ùå Built-in |
| **GATT (Generic Attribute)** | Data communication | ‚ùå Built-in |

## Android TV Side

Android TV **already supports** these protocols:
- ‚úÖ Bluetooth HID devices (keyboards, mice, remotes)
- ‚úÖ Standard pairing process
- ‚úÖ Consumer Control HID reports (volume, power, etc.)

**No custom drivers needed on Android TV either!**

## Only Requirement: Python Package

The only thing you need to install:
```bash
pip install bleak
```

This is a **Python library**, not a driver. It talks to your OS's built-in Bluetooth stack.

## Why No Custom Drivers?

1. **Standard protocols**: We use the same HID protocol as official remotes
2. **Universal support**: All devices support Bluetooth HID
3. **OS integration**: Operating systems handle the low-level Bluetooth work
4. **Plug-and-play**: Android TV treats your app like any other Bluetooth remote

## Troubleshooting "Driver" Issues

If Bluetooth doesn't work, it's usually:

### Linux
```bash
# Make sure Bluetooth service is running
sudo systemctl start bluetooth
sudo systemctl enable bluetooth

# Check if adapter is detected
hciconfig -a
```

### Windows  
- Check Device Manager ‚Üí Bluetooth
- Make sure Bluetooth is turned on in Settings
- Restart "Bluetooth Support Service" if needed

### macOS
- Check System Preferences ‚Üí Bluetooth
- Make sure Bluetooth is enabled

## Testing Without Drivers

Run our test to verify everything works:
```bash
python test_hid_server.py
```

This tests the Bluetooth functionality using only standard OS features - no custom drivers involved!
